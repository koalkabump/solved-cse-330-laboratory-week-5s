In this lab, you will implement the <strong>Infix-to-Postfix Algorithm</strong> from the lecture notes. The lab will be conducted in a <strong>“follow-the-leader”</strong> format … the instructor will provide (a lot of) guidance in getting the lecture notes algorithm translated into working C++ code.




The ability to implement in programming language code any algorithm that someone may place in front of you is one of the most important skills to acquire as an aspiring computer science professional. No other discipline really does this sort of thing …




This lab is geared to showing you how to approach such task, which may appear daunting initially. Practice builds confidence and expertise, and we will engage in some collective practice here …




<strong>Step 0:</strong> Make sure that you have the Infix-to-Postfix Algorithm in front of you (consult lecture notes).




<strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a file infix2postfix.cpp (or other name of your choice) and make sure that you follow along as the program is evolving …




<ul>

 <li>This will be “life-coding” and you are being asked to be on the alert for bugs, typos or other flaws as they are bound to pop up in the process.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>If you have any burning question that prevent you from following along/keeping up, DO ASK.</li>

</ul>




<strong>Step 2: </strong>Test your implementation thoroughly with a good set of non-trivial infix expressions. Enjoy the resulting postfix expressions which you would most likely not have wanted to generate by hand.




<strong>Credit for this lab: </strong>(1) Make sure to sign the <strong>signup sheet</strong>. (2) Portal submission of your .cpp file (should contain all code) and a typescript for 3 non-trivial test runs.
